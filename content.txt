Software engineering isn't about writing code—it's about identifying what actually matters and building it to survive reality.


Data infrastructure that processes what you need, when you need it.
ML pipelines that deploy, scale, and stay deployed.
Automation that eliminates work instead of creating it.

Everyone's chasing AI hype while ignoring the fundamental truth: models are only as good as their
data. You can't build on broken infrastucture.

We write every line ourselves. Skilled local talent. No outsourcing to
shitty overseas bodyshops. Ever.

We build systems your team will own, extend, and understand.

We ship on deadline. No meetings unless they solve something specific.

Python, LangChain, AWS, Snowflake, dbt, Airflow, Postgres, Databricks,
Hugging Face. Whatever works. Simple beats complex.
